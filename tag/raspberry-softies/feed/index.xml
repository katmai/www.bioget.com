<p>i had no idea i was saving the single pack of Raspberry Softies for her, as i unpacked all the supplies. The guy wanted to take it and put it in the box, but i told him that&#8217;s for me, so we left it in the car as we carried everything inside.</p>



<p>i then saw her asking for something, from the lady at the reception and the lady came back with a slice of bread and a pâté can, from the things i had brought, and gave it to her. She took it, went to her backpack, and was placing them inside. i keep wondering right now, why She didn&#8217;t receive any of the biscuits or the wafers or the coffee that i had brought earlier, but it&#8217;s not up to me to decide who gets what, i just deliver. Would be nice if everyone does their job and the goods get to the people.</p>



<p>Then i realized that i saved the box of Raspberry Softies for her. i went to my car and got it, then, went back inside.</p>



<p>As i leaned in to give her the box, She froze. </p>



<p>Her eyes were glued to it, and it broke my heart. It took her a few seconds to move. Her hand was trembling as she reached for the box and when she finally looked at me, i could see her eyes questioning, confused as to why am i doing this. i could almost feel that she hasn&#8217;t been treated like a human being in god knows how long. i gave Her 10$ and that confused her even more. She looked at the money and at the box again and then i left her.</p>
